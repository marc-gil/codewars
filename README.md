# codewars

Here, I post my codewars solutions to various Codewars katas, implemented in Java. 
The repository is structured to include both the solution and the corresponding test cases.

***Codewarriors are strongly encouraged not to look at my Kata's solutions until trying to solve it themselves***

## About
[Codewars](https://codewars.com) is a platform for developers to train their coding skills by solving challenges called "katas." 
Each kata has a specific difficulty level called kyu, which goes from 8 being the easiet to 1 being the hardest.

In this repository, I share my solutions for various Java katas, along with the original test cases provided on the platform. 
My goal is to track my progress, share my learning, and offer guidance to others working on the same katas.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

    /src
       ├── /main/java/dev/marcgil/codewars
       │    ├── [kyu level]
       │    │    └── [KataName.java]        # Solution file

            ├── [kyu level]
            │    └── [KataNameTest.java]    # Test cases (as provided by Codewars)
